## A Journey Through Flutter

Flutter is a dart framework for building beautiful and fast mobile, web, windows and Mac applications.

Before flutter, I concentrated on only one language to nail all the challages i faced, and that was python. I built all things and everything in the django web framework as it had all the cool stuff out of the box i.e. database, webserver and a fantastic templating system.

Some of my online beauties built with python include;
- http://moviefimbooo.herokuapp.com/ A beautifully designed template for a movie database system.
- www.bdoprime.com An invoicing, and utilities app for BDO Uganda.

Offline
- A tweeter bot, Ugabot
- Checkers AI bot
- Bike management system
- School management system
etc.

With flutter, I tend to post all the projects am learning from. Success stories will also be part of this flutter journey Rblog(repository blog).
